## About Me
I am Chandan Kumar, a software engineer exploring the art of entrepreneurship. My primary expertise lies in backend development, where I've worked extensively with Node.js, Express, Java, and Spring Boot. I also have conceptual knowledge of blockchain and generative AI. 

## Side Projects
I enjoy building side projects to learn new technologies. Some of my notable projects include:

### Linkd Master
A ChatGPT plugin that allowed users to post directly on LinkedIn from the ChatGPT interface. The project gained over 500 users within a month but was paused due to my full-time job and the challenges of early-stage development.

### MeraBot AI
A project I'm particularly excited about: a personalized AI assistant for everyone. More details will be shared soon.

## Startup Involvement
I've had the opportunity to help a couple of startups build their Proof of Concepts (POCs).

## Current Focus
I'm planning to restart and rebuild **Linkd Master**. This time, I'll be migrating the server from Express.js to Golang as part of my journey to learn Golang. I'll be sharing my progress and experiences along the way.

## Let's Connect
If any of these projects or topics interest you, feel free to connect with me. We can learn, share, and follow along together.

Thanks!
