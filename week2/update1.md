# Week 2: Update 1

Welcome to Week 2!

## Golang Exploration

I've recently started learning Golang, having prior experience with Express.js and Spring Boot (Java). My goal is to understand how Golang differs from these technologies.

### Blog Post
I've written a blog on this topic, which you can read on Medium:
[Golang Internals for Java/JavaScript Developers - Part 1](https://medium.com/@vivekans2016/golang-internals-for-java-javascript-developers-part-1-73810b0cf4db)

### Key Learnings
- **Concurrency vs. Parallelism:** Understanding the concepts and their differences.
- **Concurrency in Go:** Exploring Go's concurrency patterns.

#### Recommended Resources
I found this YouTube playlist very helpful in explaining concurrency:

### Practical Steps
- Installed Golang and ran a "Hello World" program.

## Docker Exploration

To streamline the deployment of **Linkd Master**, I've decided to use Docker. Here's what I've been up to:

- **Installed Docker**
- **Learned About:**
  - Dockerfiles
  - Docker Compose
  - Docker Images

## Next Steps

Next, I'll be working on setting up some CRUD APIs using Golang and Docker. Stay tuned for more updates!
